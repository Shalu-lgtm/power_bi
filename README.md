coffe_quality_analysis project 
🚀 Excited to share my latest project as a Data Analyst Aspirant! 🚀

I recently completed a comprehensive coffee quality analysis project for the Coffee Quality Institute, using Power BI. Here's a sneak peek into my approach and key insights:

🔍 **Research and Understanding**:
- Delved into the Coffee Quality Institute's aims and stakeholder needs.
- Gained a thorough understanding of the coffee life cycle from planting to brewing.

🛠️ **Data Processing**:
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query.
- Categorized data to enhance summarization and analysis.

📊 **Visualization**:
- Created interactive dashboards showcasing coffee quality metrics, such as varieties, regions, moisture percentages, and defect categories.
- Analyzed the impact of altitude on acidity and sensory attributes like aroma and aftertaste.

🌟 **Key Insights**:
- Identified correlations between coffee varieties and overall quality.
- Highlighted regional differences and their effects on coffee characteristics.
- Provided actionable recommendations for growers, processors, and brewers to enhance coffee quality.

📚 **Ethiopia Case Study**:
- **Addis Ababa**: High altitude with slightly low moisture content. Key findings include good acidity, balance, and aroma. Recommendations focus on improving flavor through variety change or processing adjustments.
- **Southern Ethiopian Gji**: Very high moisture with natural/dry processing method. Showcased strong acidity, good body, and excellent aftertaste and flavor. Addressed defect management with destoners.
- **Oromia**: Strong acidity with washed and wet processing methods. Emphasized the importance of balance and aroma in achieving excellent coffee quality.
- **Guji and Gedeb**: High altitude with slight moisture variations. Highlighted processing improvements to enhance acidity and aroma. Recommendations include optimizing processing methods for better quality.
- **Ethiopian City**: Addressed foreign matter defects with destoners and emphasized careful processing and harvesting techniques to maintain high-quality standards.

🚨 **Defect Analysis**:
- **Category 1 Defects**: Severe defects like full black and full sour that significantly impact coffee quality. Strategies include improving processing techniques and careful harvesting.
- **Category 2 Defects**: Less severe but notable defects such as partial black and insect-damaged beans. Recommendations focus on moisture management and proper storage to reduce these defects.
- **Moisture-Related Defects**: High moisture levels can lead to issues like insect damage and mold. Solutions include optimizing drying techniques and using destoners to remove foreign matter.
- **Processing-Related Defects**: Issues like parchment and hull/husk defects arise from improper processing methods. Ensuring thorough pulping, hulling, and drying processes can mitigate these defects.

This project not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the intricate world of coffee. Looking forward to applying these insights in future data-driven endeavors!
